## 📊 Question Type Strategies

### Scenario-Based Questions (Most Common)
```
FORMAT:
"A company has [situation]. The solution must [requirements].
Which approach provides [objective]?"

STRATEGY:
1. Identify key requirements (HA, cost, performance, security)
2. Eliminate answers that don't meet requirements
3. Choose MOST cost-effective OR MOST appropriate
4. Read carefully: "MOST", "LEAST", "BEST"

COMMON KEYWORDS:
├── "MOST cost-effective" → Cheapest valid option
├── "MOST secure" → Defense in depth, least privilege
├── "LEAST operational overhead" → Managed services, serverless
├── "HIGH availability" → Multi-AZ
└── "LOW latency" → Caching, CDN, regional deployment
```

### Distractor Answers (What to Avoid)
```
WATCH OUT FOR:
❌ Over-complicated solutions (AWS prefers simple)
❌ Manual processes (automation preferred)
❌ Single points of failure
❌ Outdated services (CloudFormation > Elastic Beanstalk config)
❌ More expensive when cheaper option exists
❌ Non-AWS solutions (they want AWS services)
```

## 🔥 Exam Hot Topics (Critical!)

### Top 20 Services (Know These Cold!)
```
MUST MASTER (80% of exam):
1. EC2 (instance types, pricing, placement groups)
2. S3 (storage classes, lifecycle, versioning, encryption)
3. VPC (subnets, security groups, NACLs, routing)
4. IAM (users, roles, policies, policy evaluation)
5. RDS (Multi-AZ, Read Replicas, Aurora)
6. Route 53 (routing policies, health checks)
7. CloudFront (caching, origins, signed URLs)
8. ALB/NLB (types, features, use cases)
9. Auto Scaling (policies, health checks)
10. DynamoDB (keys, GSI, LSI, DAX)
11. Lambda (limits, triggers, use cases)
12. CloudWatch (metrics, logs, alarms)
13. CloudTrail (API logging, validation)
14. EBS (volume types, snapshots, encryption)
15. ElastiCache (Redis vs Memcached)
16. SQS/SNS (queue types, fan-out pattern)
17. KMS (key types, envelope encryption)
18. EFS (vs EBS, use cases)
19. AWS Organizations (SCPs, consolidated billing)
20. Backup strategies (snapshots, AMIs, lifecycle)
```

### Common Exam Patterns
```
PATTERN 1: Choose Between Services
Q: "Database for key-value lookups with millisecond latency?"
A: DynamoDB (not RDS)

PATTERN 2: Cost Optimization
Q: "Reduce costs for predictable EC2 workload?"
A: Reserved Instances or Savings Plans

PATTERN 3: High Availability
Q: "Application must survive AZ failure?"
A: Multi-AZ deployment (ALB, RDS, etc.)

PATTERN 4: Security
Q: "Prevent public access to sensitive data?"
A: Private subnets + Security Groups + Encryption

PATTERN 5: Performance
Q: "Reduce latency for global users?"
A: CloudFront + Multi-region + Route 53

PATTERN 6: Disaster Recovery
Q: "RTO 1 hour, RPO 15 minutes?"
A: Pilot Light or Warm Standby
```

## 💡 The Elimination Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach
```
STEP 1: Identify Requirements
├── Read question twice
├── Highlight: "MOST", "LEAST", "cost-effective", "secure"
├── Note: HA needs, performance needs, compliance
└── Identify: What problem needs solving?

STEP 2: Eliminate Obviously Wrong
❌ Doesn't meet stated requirement
❌ Wrong service for the job
❌ Violates security/compliance
❌ Single point of failure (when HA needed)

STEP 3: Compare Remaining Options
├── Cost: If multiple work, choose cheaper
├── Simplicity: Fewer components usually better
├── Managed: Prefer managed over self-managed
└── AWS-native: Prefer AWS services over 3rd party

STEP 4: Choose Best Answer
├── Re-read question
├── Verify answer meets ALL requirements
└── Select and move on (don't overthink!)
```

### Quick Decision Trees

#### Database Selection
```
1. Need SQL?
   YES → RDS or Aurora
   NO → Continue
   
2. Need NoSQL?
   Key-Value → DynamoDB
   Document → DocumentDB
   Graph → Neptune
   
3. For RDS, need performance?
   5x MySQL → Aurora
   Standard → RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL
   
4. For Analytics?
   Data Warehouse → Redshift
   Query S3 → Athena
```

#### Storage Selection
```
1. What type?
   Objects → S3
   Blocks → EBS
   Files → EFS/FSx
   
2. For S3, how often accessed?
   Frequently → Standard
   Infrequently → Standard-IA
   Unknown → Intelligent-Tiering
   Archive → Glacier
   
3. For EBS, what performance?
   General → gp3
   High IOPS → io2
   Throughput → st1
```

## 🎯 Common Traps to Avoid

### Classic Exam Tricks
```
TRAP 1: "All answers seem correct"
→ Look for "MOST" or "LEAST" qualifier
→ Choose best fit for scenario

TRAP 2: Unfamiliar service mentioned
→ Usually a distractor
→ Choose familiar AWS service

TRAP 3: Over-engineered solution
→ AWS prefers simplicity
→ Choose simpler, managed solution

TRAP 4: Outdated approach
→ Avoid deprecated services
→ Choose modern AWS services

TRAP 5: Multi-requirement question
→ Answer must satisfy ALL requirements
→ One missed requirement = wrong answer

TRAP 6: Similar sounding services
→ Kinesis Data Streams vs Firehose
→ Know the differences!
```

### Red Flags (Usually Wrong Answers)
```
❌ "Set up your own ______" (when managed service exists)
❌ Single AZ when HA is mentioned
❌ EC2 instance store for persistent data
❌ Public subnet for database
❌ Security Group DENY rules (they don't exist)
❌ VPC Peering is transitive (it's not!)
❌ Forgetting Multi-AZ for RDS HA
❌ Using CLB (deprecated, use ALB/NLB)
❌ Manual scaling when Auto Scaling works
❌ Not using roles for EC2 (embedding credentials)
```

## 💪 Confidence Boosters

### You Know This If You Can Answer:
```
1. Multi-AZ vs Read Replicas? (HA vs Read scaling)
2. Security Group vs NACL? (Stateful vs Stateless)
3. S3 Standard vs Glacier? (Hot vs Archive)
4. EC2 Reserved vs Spot? (Stable vs Flexible)
5. RDS vs DynamoDB? (SQL vs NoSQL)
6. ALB vs NLB? (Layer 7 vs Layer 4)
7. Public vs Private subnet? (IGW route vs NAT)
8. IAM Role vs User? (Temporary vs Permanent)
9. CloudWatch vs CloudTrail? (Metrics vs API logs)
10. SNS vs SQS? (Pub/sub vs Queue)

If you answered all correctly: You're ready! ✅
```
