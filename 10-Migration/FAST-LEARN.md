## 📊 Quick Reference Tables

### Snow Family (Physical Data Transfer)
| Device | Capacity | Use Case | Transfer Speed |
|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Snowcone** | 8 TB | Edge computing, small transfers | Portable (fits in backpack) |
| **Snowball Edge Storage** | 80 TB | Large migrations, edge storage | Petabyte scale |
| **Snowball Edge Compute** | 42 TB + GPU | ML, processing at edge | Compute + storage |

└── CDC only (replicate changes)
```

### Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
```
WHEN NEEDED: Heterogeneous migrations
├── Oracle → PostgreSQL ✅

✅ Private connection
❌ Weeks to months setup
❌ Expensive

SNOWBALL:
✅ 10+ TB data
✅ Poor internet
✅ One-time migration
❌ Shipping time (days)

DATASYNC:
✅ Scheduled transfers
✅ NFS/SMB sources
✅ Automated
❌ Limited to 10 Gbps

TRANSFER FAMILY:
✅ SFTP/FTP protocol needed
✅ External users uploading
❌ Higher cost
```

## 🚀 5-Minute Master Review

### Migration Decision Tree
```
1. What are you migrating?
   DATABASE → DMS (+ SCT if needed)
   FILES → DataSync or Storage Gateway
   SERVERS → Application Migration Service
   LARGE DATA → Snow family
   
2. For databases, same engine?
   YES → DMS only
   NO → DMS + SCT
   
3. For data transfer, how much?
   < 10 TB + good internet → Direct upload/DataSync
   10 TB - 10 PB + slow internet → Snowball
   > 10 PB → Snowmobile
   
4. Need ongoing sync?
   YES → Storage Gateway or DMS (CDC)
   NO → DataSync or Snow family
```

### Common Migration Patterns
```
1. DATABASE MIGRATION (Zero Downtime)
   On-prem DB → DMS (CDC) → RDS → Cutover
   
2. LIFT-AND-SHIFT (Servers)
   On-prem servers → MGN → EC2
   
3. FILE SHARE TO CLOUD
   On-prem NFS → DataSync → EFS → Cutover
   
4. LARGE DATA TRANSFER
   Datacenter → Snowball → S3 → Process
   
5. HYBRID STORAGE
   On-prem apps ←→ Storage Gateway ←→ S3
```

### DMS Best Practices
✅ Use Multi-AZ for production
✅ Enable CloudWatch logging
✅ Test with validation enabled
✅ Use CDC for minimal downtime
✅ Size replication instance appropriately
✅ Use SCT assessment before migration
✅ Migrate to Aurora when possible (better performance)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Using internet for massive data transfer (use Snow)
❌ Not testing DMS migration before cutover
❌ Forgetting SCT for heterogeneous migrations
❌ Choosing wrong Snow device for data size
❌ Not considering bandwidth for transfer time
❌ Using deprecated SMS (use MGN instead)
❌ Not enabling validation in DMS
❌ Underestimating replication instance size
